<p>How to create a clone of an object using clone method: 1. Highlights
the problem with shallow copy:

<ol type="1">
<li>Shallow copy is the method of copying an object and is followed by
default in cloning.</li>
<li>In this method, the fields of an old object X are copied to the new
object Y.</li>
<li>While copying the object type field the reference is copied to Y i.e
object Y will point to the same location as pointed out by X.</li>
<li>If the field value is a primitive type it copies the value of the
primitive type.</li>
</ol>
<p>Point 3 presents the problem with shallow copying; Any changes made
to such a copy will reflect in all other objects that were cloned which
in most cases is not what we want Thus we create a deep copy Source:
